    "content": "**Can technology actually bring me closer to Jesus?**\n\nThat's the question I asked when Bible Mentor AI was just an idea. This project was never about replacing the Bible — it was about meeting people in the moment they open their phone, and gently guiding them back to the Word.\n\nI believe the Holy Spirit can work through any tool that honors Scripture. I’ve seen it happen here already, and I'm walking in faith that it will continue. I want to help people find the Word. That's what this project is all about."

    "content": "We live in a world flooded with content, distractions, and endless scrolling. I know I am and continue to be guilty of falling into these distractions and losing sight of His light. In the chaos, it’s easy to forget what God did for us just last week — let alone last year. That’s why spiritual memory isn’t optional. It’s vital.\n\n**Bible Mentor AI is built to remember what God has done in your life.** Not so we can analyze or judge, but so _you_ can reflect, rejoice, and grow. When you revisit that reflection you wrote on grace, or see how your questions have shifted over time, it reveals God’s hand at work.\n\nDon’t just move forward in faith — look back with purpose. Your spiritual story is unfolding. Let’s help you see it."
