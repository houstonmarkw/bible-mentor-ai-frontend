        <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg mb-6">
          We believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, the Savior of the world, and the Way to eternal life.
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-4 text-gray-700 text-base">
          <li>God is the Creator of all things, and His love, justice, and holiness are perfect.</li>
          <li>God is one in essence and three in persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</li>
          <li>Jesus lived a sinless life, performed miracles, died for our sins, and rose from the dead.</li>
          <li>The Bible is the inspired Word of God and reveals His plan for salvation and righteous living.</li>
          <li>Salvation is a free gift received through faith in Jesus Christâ€”not earned by works.</li>
          <li>The Holy Spirit indwells and empowers believers to follow Jesus, grow in holiness, and share the Gospel.</li>
          <li>The Church is the global body of believers, united by Christ and called to love and serve.</li>
          <li>Eternal life begins now by knowing Jesus (John 17:3) and continues with God forever.</li>
        </ul>
