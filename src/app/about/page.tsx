        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mt-10 mb-4">Why We Built This</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Bible Mentor AI started as a simple idea: <em>What if your Bible study could feel like a conversation—one that actually helped you grow?</em>
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
          Founder Mark Houston began reading the Bible deeply for the first time in 2025 and found himself transformed. He realized that faith isn’t about performing religion—it’s about knowing Jesus. Built from both conviction and calling, Bible Mentor AI is a witness to the living Word—offering guidance, clarity, and peace in a noisy world.
