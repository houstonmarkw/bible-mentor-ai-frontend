          About Bible Mentor AI
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Bible Mentor AI exists to make your walk with Jesus deeper, daily, and more personal—through the Word, not around it. This isn’t a replacement for faith. It’s a companion for your journey.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          We’ve built a growing system of <strong>faith tracks</strong>—guided spiritual paths focused on everything from knowing Jesus, to fatherhood, to grace, to building new habits. You’ll receive a daily devotional designed just for you, shaped by where you’ve been and where God’s leading you.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
          All rooted in Scripture. All crafted with care. This project began as one man’s commitment to finish reading the Bible in a year and became a calling to help others walk closer to Christ. Now it’s growing into a spiritual companion for anyone seeking more.
